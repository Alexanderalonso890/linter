    <p>The Missoula Marathon course is flat, fast, USATF certified, and a Boston Qualifier! The marathon course does have a significant hill at the halfway point. The course is a point-to-point, beginning with a scenic route through the countryside and finishing in historic downtown Missoula. The marathon course is well marked with both cones and arrows on the road. You will notice every mile is marked on the road and with 8ft tall mile markers.</p>
    <p>Wheelchair and Handcycle: We are pleased to offer wheelchair and handcycle divisions in the 2016 Full and Half Marathon.</p>
