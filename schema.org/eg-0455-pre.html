                <cite>My Bed</cite> was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in
                <time datetime="1998">1999</time> as one
                of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her
                bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media
                attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has
                persisted.

            The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the
            fact that the bedsheets were stained with bodily secretions and the floor
            had items from the artist's room (such as condoms, a pair of knickers with
            menstrual period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects,
            including a pair of slippers). The bed was presented in the state that
            Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for
            several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship
            difficulties.
