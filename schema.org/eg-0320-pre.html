Fairly straightforward painting markup.

    <div>
        <h1 lang="fr">La trahison des images </h1>
        <p>
            A painting also known as The Treason of Images or
            The Treachery of Images.
        </p>
        <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg" />
        <div>
            <p>
                The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted,
                <q lang="fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</q>, French for
                "This is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                His statement is taken to mean that the painting itself is not a pipe.
                The painting is merely an image of a pipe. Hence, the description,
                "this is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the image shown above is neither a pipe nor even a painting,
                but rather a digital photograph.
            </p>
            <p>
                The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed
                by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski's <q>The word is not the thing</q>
                and <q>The map is not the territory</q>.
