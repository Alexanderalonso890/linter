<h1>Stable angina (angina pectoris)</h1>
Stable angina is a medical condition that affects the heart. The
most common causes are atherosclerosis and spasms of the
epicardial artery. Typical symptoms include:
<ul>
  <li>chest discomfort</li>
  <li>feeling of tightness, heaviness, or pain in the chest</li>
</ul>
Both stable angina and a heart attack result in chest pain, but
a heart attack will have chest pain lasting at least
10 minutes at rest, repeated episodes of chest pain at rest
lasting 5 or more minutes, or an accelerating pattern of chest
discomfort (episodes that are more frequent, severe,
longer in duration, and precipitated by minimal exertion).
<br>
Risk factors for stable angina include:
<ul>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Gender</li>
  <li>Systolic blood pressure</li>
  <li>Smoking</li>
  <li>Total cholesterol and/or cholesterol:HDL ratio</li>
  <li>Coronary artery disease</li>
</ul>
The initial treatment for stable angina is usually drug therapy
with aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and/or nitroglycerine.
Future episodes of stable angina can sometimes be prevented by
stopping smoking, weight management, and increased physical activity.
