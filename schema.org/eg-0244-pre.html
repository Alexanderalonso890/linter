An Event runs on the second Monday of every month, from 6pm-7:30pm. Because this kind of recurrence goes beyond that expressible using <a href="https://schema.org/DayOfWeek">https://schema.org/DayOfWeek</a>, it is specified instead using iCal's <a href="https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-5-3-recurrence-rule.html">syntax for byDay recurrence rules</a>.
