                <cite>Still Life under the Lamp</cite>, from 1962, made when the artist
                was eighty years old, are counted among Picasso’s most important works
                in linocut, a technique that he explored in the late 1950s and early
                1960s. The progressive proofs show the step by step sequence by which
                Picasso created his linocut images showing the development of the
                image into its final form.
